# SQL-Employee-Tracker

## Description


This application is an employee tracker using mysql. This allows non developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases like mysql. This application uses Node.js and Inquirer to easily display the data in an organized clean fashion. Making this application showed me how schema files work which includes creating databases and also dropping data into these databases created. 

## Usage

- Once opened you would run node server.js
